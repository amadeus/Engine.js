# Engine.js

Engine.js is a very simplistic base framework for iterating and prototyping
various animations or simulations on a canvas tag using
`.requestAnimationFrame`.

The idea is that all you need is a canvas tag, a run loop, a vector library,
and a module system.

To get started, simply open up `index.html` in your favorite browser (that
supports the canvas tag) and pop into `App.js` to see how it works.

Documentation is forthcoming.
